A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

#To-Do

If you want, I can also show:

✅ Real-world example with pagination
✅ AsyncNotifier + debounce + search
✅ How to keep cache alive with keepAlive: true
✅ How to handle AsyncValue.guard() for safer try/catch


If you want, I can show you:

🔥 Example with pagination
🔥 Example with search + debounce
🔥 Example with stale UI while background refreshing


If you want, I can show:

🔥 Example of AsyncValue with nested “refreshing" or “updating” states
🔥 Example of background loaders + maybeWhen
🔥 Example where .isLoading fails but maybeWhen works

Which one would you like?

Learn **ref.listenManual(usersProvider, (_, __) {});**


This is why .maybeWhen is more reliable and used in professional Riverpod codebases.

If you want, I can also show:
📘 A full example with pull-to-refresh
📘 A pagination example where .isLoading fails
📘 An approach combining .maybeWhen with optimistic updates

Just tell me


✔ a silent background refresh version
✔ a version with pull-to-refresh
✔ a version that shows only a small top refresh indicator instead of center loader

Just tell me!
